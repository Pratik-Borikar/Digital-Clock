# Digital-Clock

### Basic steps to build a Digital Clock with gui using Python Programming Language

#### In order to build the Digital Clock with GUI in Python, we will need the following modules:

Tkinter :- The tkinter module will allow us to provide the application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Time :- The time module will allow us to work with time.

Step 1 :- Import the package.

Step 2 :- Define a window screen.

Step 3 :- I added a footer label on the window screen too. 

Step 4 :- Define the time function.

Step 5 :- Style the clock widget to make it attractive.
